# KeyHog GitHub Action — drop-in secret scanning

One step in your workflow. Findings fail the job, the report uploads to
GitHub code-scanning, and a copy of the report attaches as a workflow
artifact for download.

```yaml
- uses: santhsecurity/keyhog/.github/actions/keyhog@v0.5.15
```

That's it. Defaults: scan the whole repo, fail on `high` or above, output
SARIF, upload to code-scanning.

## Full reference

```yaml
- uses: santhsecurity/keyhog/.github/actions/keyhog@v0.5.15
  with:
    path: .                     # file or directory to scan
    severity: high              # info | low | medium | high | critical
    format: sarif               # text | json | sarif | jsonl
    verify: 'false'             # 'true' to live-verify credentials
    upload-sarif: 'true'        # 'false' to keep the report local-only
    fail-on-findings: 'true'    # 'false' to make findings advisory
    version: ''                 # pin a specific release (default: action ref)
```

## Outputs

```yaml
- id: keyhog
  uses: santhsecurity/keyhog/.github/actions/keyhog@v0.5.15
  with:
    fail-on-findings: 'false'

- name: Comment on PR if anything found
  if: steps.keyhog.outputs.findings != '0'
  run: gh pr comment ${{ github.event.number }} -b "KeyHog flagged ${{ steps.keyhog.outputs.findings }} potential secret(s)."
```

| Output | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `findings` | Number of findings at or above `severity`. |
| `report`   | Path to the produced report file. |

## Platforms

| OS | arch | Prebuilt binary | Source-build fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | x86_64 | yes (full features) | yes |
| macOS | aarch64 | yes (no Hyperscan) | yes (`portable` feature) |
| macOS | x86_64 | no | yes (`portable` feature) |
| Windows | * | no | manual — see DROP_IN_USAGE.md |

The action tries the prebuilt binary first and only falls back to a
source build when the release asset is missing. macOS builds (both
prebuilt and source fallback) ship without Hyperscan because there is
no `libhyperscan-dev` package in homebrew; everything else (entropy,
multiline reassembly, ML scoring, decode-through, all source backends)
is included.
