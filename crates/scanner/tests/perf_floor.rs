//! Throughput regression floor for the scanner.
//!
//! Asserts that `CompiledScanner::scan` on a representative
//! source-code fixture stays AT OR ABOVE a hard MiB/s floor. The
//! floor is intentionally conservative (well below current steady-
//! state numbers) so that ordinary noise doesn't redden the gate,
//! but a 2× slowdown — the kind of regression a real algorithm
//! change would introduce — will reliably fail this.
//!
//! Why a test, not a criterion bench: criterion benches run on
//! demand and aren't part of CI's `cargo test`. A floor test runs
//! every CI build, so a perf regression hits the same review surface
//! as any other red gate. The criterion benches in
//! `crates/scanner/benches/` are the right place for fine-grained
//! perf trends; this file is the throughput TRIPWIRE.
//!
//! Fixture shape: 4 MiB of pseudo-Go-source with NO planted
//! credentials — the test measures the fast-path (alphabet screen +
//! bigram bloom + AC pre-filter early-reject) throughput on benign
//! code, which is what 99%+ of a real repository looks like. A
//! credential-dense workload would primarily measure ML scoring +
//! suppression-heuristic overhead, which is a different gate.
//!
//! For the K8s differential bench (1.8x faster than gitleaks on
//! 1.2 GiB) the rayon-parallel + per-file shape pushes throughput to
//! ~540 MiB/s; this per-chunk single-thread test floors at ~12 MiB/s
//! and asserts at 8 MiB/s with 33% headroom under measured.
